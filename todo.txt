### High-Level Plan for Web Scraping Microservices with Flask, Go, RabbitMQ, gRPC, and REST API

#### 1. Project Overview:
- Flask Web App (Python):
  - Accepts URLs from users to scrape.
  - Sends URLs to a RabbitMQ queue for processing by a Go worker.
  - Displays real-time scraping status updates (using gRPC from the Go worker).
  - Allows users to view results via a REST API (GET requests to fetch scraped data).

- Go Worker:
  - Listens to RabbitMQ for URLs.
  - Scrapes data from the given URLs.
  - Sends status updates back to the Flask app via gRPC (e.g., "scraping started", "scraping complete").
  - Stores scraped data in a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

- RabbitMQ:
  - Acts as a message queue between the Flask app and Go worker to decouple the services.
  - Ensures that scraping tasks are processed asynchronously.

- REST API:
  - Exposes an endpoint to allow users to retrieve stored scraped data (GET request).
  - Allows Go worker to push scraped data to the Flask app (POST request).

#### 2. Core Technologies:
- Flask: Python web framework for handling user input and REST API.
- Go: Programming language for the scraping worker (handling concurrency with goroutines).
- RabbitMQ: Message broker for decoupling services (Python sends tasks to Go).
- gRPC: For real-time status updates between Go worker and Flask.
- Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL): To store scraped data.
- GitLab CI/CD: Continuous integration and deployment.

#### 3. Daily Breakdown:

#### Day 1: Setup and Flask Web App
- Setup:
  - Set up a new Flask project.
  - Install necessary dependencies (Flask, grpcio, pika for RabbitMQ).
- Flask Web App:
  - Create a simple form where users can enter a URL to scrape.
  - Set up the API route to accept URLs and send them to RabbitMQ for processing.
  - Add a placeholder REST API endpoint to retrieve the scraped data (we'll implement the database part later).

#### Day 2: Set Up RabbitMQ and Go Worker
- RabbitMQ Setup:
  - Install RabbitMQ locally or use Docker to run a RabbitMQ instance.
  - Set up the Go worker to listen for messages from RabbitMQ (URLs to scrape).
- Go Worker:
  - Install necessary Go packages (goroutines for concurrency, go-rabbitmq for message handling).
  - Implement a basic Go worker that receives URLs from RabbitMQ and scrapes the page using a Go scraping library (e.g., Colly).
  - Log each step of the scraping process (e.g., "scraping started", "scraping completed").

#### Day 3: Implement gRPC for Status Updates
- gRPC Setup:
  - Set up gRPC server in the Go worker.
  - Define a simple gRPC protocol to send status updates (e.g., "scraping started", "scraping completed").
  - Set up the Flask app to receive status updates via gRPC (you'll need grpcio for Python and define the same protocol as in Go).
- Flask Web App:
  - Implement a listener in Flask to receive and display the status updates in real-time to the user.

#### Day 4: Implement Database for Storing Scraped Data
- Database Setup:
  - Set up MongoDB or PostgreSQL (choose one) for storing scraped data.
  - Define a schema (e.g., URL, scraped content, status).
  - Implement code in Flask to store scraped data in the database once received from Go via gRPC.
- Go Worker:
  - After scraping the data, push the data to Flask via gRPC and store it in the database.

#### Day 5: REST API for Viewing Data
- REST API Implementation:
  - Create a REST endpoint in Flask to retrieve scraped data (e.g., GET /scraped-data/{url}).
  - Allow users to view the scraped content and status of each URL.
  - Add a listing endpoint GET /scraped-data/ to list all scraped URLs.

#### Day 6: Integrate and Test
- End-to-End Testing:
  - Test the flow from Flask accepting a URL → sending to RabbitMQ → Go worker scraping → sending updates via gRPC → Flask storing data in the database → user viewing results via REST API.
  - Make sure that all services are properly integrated and communicate smoothly.
  - Test failure cases (e.g., invalid URLs, failed scrapes).

#### Day 7: Set Up CI/CD with GitLab
- CI/CD Pipeline:
  - Set up GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment.
  - Define separate jobs for Python/Flask, Go worker, and database services.
  - Automate testing and deployment to a local Kubernetes cluster (or cloud if possible).
  - Make sure everything is deployed automatically upon code push.

#### 4. Key Features to Focus On:
- Real-time Status Updates via gRPC: This will showcase your ability to integrate microservices with asynchronous communication.
- Database Storage: Storing scraped data in a database is important for persistence and querying.
- REST API: Exposing a RESTful service to retrieve data is common in many systems, making this a good showcase of your skills.
- Concurrency: Use of goroutines in Go will highlight your ability to manage multiple tasks simultaneously.

---

#### 5. Key Considerations:
- Error Handling: Make sure to handle network errors, invalid URLs, and other failures gracefully.
- Scalability: You can scale the Go worker later by adding more instances if you need to handle a larger number of scraping tasks.
- Clean API Design: Keep your REST API well-documented, following best practices for endpoints and request/response structures.
- CI/CD: Focus on automation with GitLab CI/CD to build, test, and deploy your application.

---

#### 6. Final Thoughts:
By the end of the week, you will have a complete, end-to-end web scraping microservice application that demonstrates key concepts for the interview. You’ll showcase microservice architecture, message queues, gRPC communication, concurrent processing with Go, REST API design, and CI/CD automation.

Good luck with the project! Feel free to reach out if you need help along the way!
